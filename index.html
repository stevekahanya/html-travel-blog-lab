            <h2>My Fire Island Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My recent trip to Fire Island National Seashore was an unforgettable escape from the hustle and bustle. The primary highlight was the **vast, pristine beaches** and the iconic **Fire Island Lighthouse**. Walking the boardwalks through the maritime forest, I saw several species of birds and the famous wild deer. The unique absence of cars gives the island a tranquil, timeless feel. The air was fresh, the surf was strong, and it was the perfect place to disconnect and enjoy nature's simplicity. I highly recommend visiting Sunken Forest for a unique ecological experience!
